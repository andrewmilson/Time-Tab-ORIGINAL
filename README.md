Time Tab
========

This code repository contains all the source code for [http://mytimetab.com](http://mytimetab.com). Server side the project is built on the Python web framework [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and client side it runs off Javascript, HTML and CSS. I build the whole thing myself from the ground up. The reason for building this project was to help my dad out with tracking and reflecting on his time. It  was also to experience and learn the whole process in making a web app including coding the app, adding Terms and Conditions, configuring a server, storing passwords + user information safley and adding advertising etc. It was a fantastic learning experience and I had a lot of fun making Time Tab.

One of the things I did in this project was write pretty much everything from scratch as I wanted to get a comprehensive understanding of the whole process of making a web app. In a sense I was reinventing the wheel in all the parts of the web app, but for me it was a learning experience. I tried to set it up as a business venture and it failed in that sence, although I am not dissapointed as the information I learnt form the whole expirience was priceless. From this project I learnt a lot of what to do and what not to do.
