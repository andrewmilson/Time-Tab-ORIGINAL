Time Tab
========

This code repository contains all the source code for [http://mytimetab.com](http://mytimetab.com). The project is built on the Python web framework [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/). I build the whole thing myself from the ground up. The reason for building this project was to help my dad out with tracking and reflecting on his time. It  was also to experience and learn the whole process in making a web app from code to Terms and Conditions and storing passwords. It was a fantastic learning experience and I had a lot of fun making Time Tab.

One of the things I did in this project was write pretty much everything from scratch as I wanted to get a comprehensive understanding of the whole process of making a web app. In a sense I was reinventing the wheel in all the parts of the web app, but for me it was a learning experience more than a business venture.
